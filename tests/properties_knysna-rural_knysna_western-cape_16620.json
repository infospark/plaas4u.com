The Gouna Pass is a gravel road which connects the Gouna Forestry village in the north with the Old Cape Road close to the Simola Golf Estate. It is a spectacular drive through dense indigenous forests.\nPositioned only 13 km's, approximately 15 minutes from the centre of town in Knysna one arrives at this beautiful small holding.  Forest Edge is in the heart of Gouna, fully surrounded by private farms and SanParks with a wonderful community making it very tranquil and safe.\nSteeped in history going back to 1881 when a group of 32 Italian silk farmers were brought from Italy and were settled at Gouna to farm with silk worms and start up a silk spinning industry, unfortunately this failed and they were forced to take to farming and woodcutting on a small scale. Still standing today is the tiny church which was built then and has now been converted into a museum.\nSituated on 8.5653 hectares of flat farm land - perfect for those who want to farm, with four dams and a great variety of bird and wild life. There is a great selection of both young and mature fruit trees including plums, guava, avocado, figs, lemons, granadilla, naartjie and banana. In addition to this, there are two well managed and working beehives.\nThe newly renovated Dutch Colonial home boasts a large open plan farm style kitchen and dining area with lots of cupboards, a large walk in pantry and a lovely old, fully operational Dover stove. Large separate lounge, complete with a wood burning fireplace and doors leading out to a lovely outdoor patio. There are 3 bedrooms, with the master bedroom also having doors leading out to it's own private patio. Lovely large bathroom with a shower and a cast iron Victorian slipper bath, perfect for relaxing in. Separate loft area, with steps from the outside leading up to the loft area.\nIn addition to this three bedroom home, there is also a completely separate two bedroom cottage which still needs to be renovated and a barn.\nAn added advantage is a landing patch for a helicopter.\nThere is also a 3 phase Eskom connection if required and excellent WiFi, which is a great advantage if one wants to work remotely.\nIf you are looking for a lifestyle change and wanting to get back to nature, but still be close enough to shops, restaurants, doctors etc, this might just be your answer.\nFor a personal viewing of this little piece of eden, contact Jacqui Mitchell\n\n",
