Another spacious room is being used as lounge/reception area. The manor house is equipped with a swimming pool set at the back of the house with tranquil views. A traditional Hammam, a boutique Massage and Spa was established and beautifully integrated into the manor house. Indulge in a mediterranean influenced theme, relax and unwind the peaceful landscape in Wellington.\nThe restaurant is open for public and has been very popular for its incredible Italian-style food as well as their Sunday Brunch, which is mostly completely booked. The restaurant can seat easily 24 guests inside as well as outside on the lovely covered veranda. This can conform well with new COVID-19 regulations, which will come into place without loosing space due to social distancing limitations. Enjoy a fantastic experience while watching the Blue Train or the most luxurious train in the world, the Rovos Rail, passing by.\nThe farm consists of a further 2 cottages. These could be converted into guest cottages, could be rented out on long-term basis or even used for staff accommodation. A separate storage facility with air-conditioner was previously utilised for production such as distillery goods and/or used as a\nBoutique winery.\nA very important point, which distinguishes this farm from other farms currently on the market, is that no labourers are fully employed on the farm and therefore no labourer claims are to fear. There are neither labourer cottages nor any rights to any third party.\nThe farm provides an excellent opportunity to continue pursuing this exclusive guest house and restaurant or for further development into an exclusive lifestyle farm or a compact commercial operation.\nThe fallow land with deep soils could provide for the cultivation of a wide variety of fruit, vegetable or herbs. Water for irrigation and household purposes is derived from 3 boreholes. Currently 1 borehole is sufficient for the current use delivering approximately 25 000 litres/hour.\nThe farm could also be utilised for equestrian activities with irrigated paddocks, stables, lungeing ring and arena. Further to this, vine nursery producers might be interested in renting space on the farm due to the water supply and close proximity to Wellington, the heart of nursery vines.\nThe seller is VAT registered and will be selling the property as a going concern. The price indicated is VAT included.\n\n",
